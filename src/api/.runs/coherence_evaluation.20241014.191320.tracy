Your job is to compute an accurate evaluation score using the provided evaluation metric. You should return a single integer value between 1 to 5 representing the evaluation metric. You will include no other text or information.\n\nuser:\nCoherence of an answer is measured by how well all the sentences fit together and sound naturally as a whole. Consider the overall quality of the answer when evaluating coherence. Given the question and answer, score the coherence of answer between one to five stars using the following rating scale:\nOne star: the answer completely lacks coherence\nTwo stars: the answer mostly lacks coherence\nThree stars: the answer is partially coherent\nFour stars: the answer is mostly coherent\nFive stars: the answer has perfect coherency\n\nThis rating value should always be an integer between 1 and 5. So the rating produced should be 1 or 2 or 3 or 4 or 5.\n\nquestion: What is your favorite indoor activity and why do you enjoy it?\nanswer: I like pizza. The sun is shining.\nstars: 1\n\nquestion: Can you describe your favorite movie without giving away any spoilers?\nanswer: It is a science fiction movie. There are dinosaurs. The actors eat cake. People must stop the villain.\nstars: 2\n\nquestion: What are some benefits of regular exercise?\nanswer: Regular exercise improves your mood. A good workout also helps you sleep better. Trees are green.\nstars: 3\n\nquestion: How do you cope with stress in your daily life?\nanswer: I usually go for a walk to clear my head. Listening to music helps me relax as well. Stress is a part of life, but we can manage it through some activities.\nstars: 4\n\nquestion: What can you tell me about climate change and its effects on the environment?\nanswer: Climate change has far-reaching effects on the environment. Rising temperatures result in the melting of polar ice caps, contributing to sea-level rise. Additionally, more frequent and severe weather events, such as hurricanes and heatwaves, can cause disruption to ecosystems and human societies alike.\nstars: 5\n\nquestion: {{question}}\nanswer: {{answer}}\nstars:"

                                    "context": "Track lighting, invented by Lightolier, was popular at one period of time because it was much easier to install than recessed lighting, and individual fixtures are decorative and can be easily aimed at a wall. It has regained some popularity recently in low-voltage tracks, which often look nothing like their predecessors because they do not have the safety issues that line-voltage systems have, and are therefore less bulky and more ornamental in themselves. A master transformer feeds all of the fixtures on the track or rod with 12 or 24 volts, instead of each light fixture having its own line-to-low voltage transformer. There are traditional spots and floods, as well as other small hanging fixtures. A modified version of this is cable lighting, where lights are hung from or clipped to bare metal cables under tension",
                                    "answer": "The main transformer is the object that feeds all the fixtures in low voltage tracks."
