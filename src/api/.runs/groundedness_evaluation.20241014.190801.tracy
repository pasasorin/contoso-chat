You will include no other text or information.\nuser:\nYou will be presented with a CONTEXT and an ANSWER about that CONTEXT. You need to decide whether the ANSWER is entailed by the CONTEXT by choosing one of the following rating:\n1. 5: The ANSWER follows logically from the information contained in the CONTEXT.\n2. 1: The ANSWER is logically false from the information contained in the CONTEXT.\n3. an integer score between 1 and 5 and if such integer score does not exist, use 1: It is not possible to determine whether the ANSWER is true or false without further information.

It has regained some popularity recently in low-voltage tracks, which often look nothing like their predecessors because they do not have the safety issues that line-voltage systems have, and are therefore less bulky and more ornamental in themselves. A master transformer feeds all of the fixtures on the track or rod with 12 or 24 volts, instead of each light fixture having its own line-to-low voltage transformer. There are traditional spots and floods, as well as other small hanging fixtures. A modified version of this is cable lighting, where lights are hung from or clipped to bare metal cables under tension",
