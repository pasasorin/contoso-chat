You will include no other text or information.\nuser:\nFluency measures the quality of individual sentences in the answer, and whether they are well-written and grammatically correct. Consider the quality of individual sentences when evaluating fluency. Given the question and answer, score the fluency of the answer between one to five stars using the following rating scale:\nOne star: the answer completely lacks fluency\nTwo stars: the answer mostly lacks fluency\nThree stars: the answer is partially fluent\nFour stars: the answer is mostly fluent\nFive stars: the answer has perfect fluency\n\nThis rating value should always be an integer between 1 and 5. So the rating produced should be 1 or 2 or 3 or 4 or 5.\n\nquestion: What did you have for breakfast today?\nanswer: Breakfast today, me eating cereal and orange juice very good.\nstars: 1\n\nquestion: How do you feel when you travel alone?\nanswer: Alone travel, nervous, but excited also.

                                    "context": "Track lighting, invented by Lightolier, was popular at one period of time because it was much easier to install than recessed lighting, and individual fixtures are decorative and can be easily aimed at a wall. It has regained some popularity recently in low-voltage tracks, which often look nothing like their predecessors because they do not have the safety issues that line-voltage systems have, and are therefore less bulky and more ornamental in themselves. A master transformer feeds all of the fixtures on the track or rod with 12 or 24 volts, instead of each light fixture having its own line-to-low voltage transformer. There are traditional spots and floods, as well as other small hanging fixtures. A modified version of this is cable lighting, where lights are hung from or clipped to bare metal cables under tension",
